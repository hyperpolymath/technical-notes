# Contributing to technical-notes

Thanks for your interest. This repository follows the Hyperpolymath estate
standards defined in [hyperpolymath/standards](https://github.com/hyperpolymath/standards).

## Licence

This project is licensed under **MPL-2.0**. By contributing you agree that
your contributions are licensed under the same terms. Every source file
carries an `SPDX-License-Identifier` header; keep it when editing, and add
one to any new file.

## Development environment

A pinned dev shell is provided:

```sh
nix develop        # toolchain: git
```

Estate policy is Guix primary / Nix fallback; this repo currently ships the
Nix fallback. A `guix.scm` is welcome if you prefer the primary tier.

## Language policy

The estate restricts which languages may be used. In particular Python, Go,
TypeScript, ReScript, V-lang, Java/Kotlin, Swift and Makefiles are **not**
accepted in new code; AffineScript, Rust/SPARK, Zig, Deno, Gleam, Elixir,
Haskell, Idris2, Agda, Julia and OCaml are. CI enforces this, so check the
policy in `hyperpolymath/standards` before introducing a new language.

## Documentation format

Docs are AsciiDoc (`.adoc`) by default, including `README.adoc`. The
GitHub-required community-health files stay Markdown: `SECURITY.md`,
`CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`. Do not add a `.md`
duplicate of a doc that already exists as `.adoc`.

## Pull requests

1. Branch from `main` — do not push to `main` directly; branch protection
   requires review and passing checks.
2. Keep the change focused, and explain *why* in the PR body.
3. Make sure governance CI is green. It checks documentation presence,
   packaging policy, secrets, licence consistency and workflow security.
4. Security issues: follow `SECURITY.md` — report privately, never in a
   public issue.
